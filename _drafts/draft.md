Here's a quick rundown of what I'm running on my phone.

I get my software from these sources in this order:
1. Fdroid
2. Izzy Droid Fdroid Repo (provide a link)
3. Google Play

## Tracker Control (TC) on f-droid

Blocks most ads and trackers inside of apps in android, without this, I wouldn't feel comfortable installing sketchy software straight from the play store.

## Syncthing

Syncs photos, documents, backups, et cetera back and forth between my computers and my phone. Very usefull in niche scenarios. If you don't want to use a cloud photo backup system, you can setup a folder to send only to a computer with lots of storage, then you can also setup your computer to ignore photo deletions from your phone's folder. (tutorial?)

## Postbox Pro

Postbox Pro takes your notifications and spreads them out so you aren't bothered constantly throughout the day. You can choose which apps you see instantly, and which ones are delayed. It turns your phone into more of a mailbox than a constant river of information. I like it, the effect is subtle but helpful.
Postbox pro can be found on the PlayStore. (link)
