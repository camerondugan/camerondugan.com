Hello, just wanting to wish everyone a happy new year! 
To start of the new year, I want to review the software I'm using this year, and mention the software I'm looking forward to using:

### Software I Liked From 2021:

**Feeder on Android**
: An RSS client for Android, the only feature missing is a synced client for desktop, everything else works great.

**SyncThing on Everything**
: A folder syncing client I wish I tried sooner, I'm currently syncing my home folder across all of my devices with a single exclusion rule of '`.*`' to prevent config issues.

**Doodle on Android**
: A FOSS replacement for the Google Pixel line of wallpapers. Even if you own a pixel phone, you can have access to the other lines of pixel wallpapers. Also there's a ton of customization.

**NetGuard on Android**
: App by app firewall to prevent lazily programmed and insecure apps you want to install from accessing the internet. You can also choose to block internet access in the background. Also can give apps just access to wifi/cellular. A truelly great application, prevents a lot of offline games from loading ads.

**VS Code / Code on Linux**
: An open source version of Visual Studio Code with countless extensions. It is a text editor that works with every programming language, vim mode, and no need for modifying a config file to change settings. Works like a charm. Also has a built in terminal emulator.

### Software For 2022:

**Obsidian on Everything**
: A markdown note taking application with backlinking. Backlinking means that if I name a note 'linux', anytime I write the word 'linux' in another note, it automatically suggests a new link to that note. Plus it can visually graph all of the notes and links to other notes. I plan to use this with SyncThing as an online note-taking replacement.

**Tor Browser on Everything**
: I've known the Tor Browser has existed for a while now, but only recently I found out that bridges exist, and can easily be requested from the tor settings tab. Bridges can and often do speed up tor by quite a bit. I always assumed that Tor was just super slow. I will be using Tor a whole lot more with what I'm experiencing as about 4-10x the speed without bridges.

Thanks for reading, let's have a great 2022!
