This site is personal website/blog written in markdown! Hopefully this can work as both a way to reach more people with my personal thoughts and as a way to show off the cool things I make.

Source code for this website can be found [here!](https://gitlab.com/cameron.dugan/camerondugan.com)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [their Github!][jekyll-proj]
