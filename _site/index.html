      <p>Hello!</p>

<p>Welcome to CameronDugan.com, a place where I put my projects and thoughts into the world. I’m a linux enthusiast with enough bash experience to write a few scripts for automating my dotfiles across my computers.</p>

<p>Vim is my favourite text editor, and it shall remain that way. Anywhere I absolutely need to use something else, I usually find a way to add vim’s shortcuts back into the mix.</p>

<p>This website is running off of a raspberry pi 4 as well as my email at this domain. It took a long time (about a year), but I eventually set it up this way to reduce the overall costs of running this website. My previous vps was great, but I’ve finally figured out the networking required to get this done and I’m quite happy about it. :)</p>
