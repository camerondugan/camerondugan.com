&lt;p&gt;I’ll also try to add an RSS-Roll, hopefully it’ll be a landmine of good feeds that I subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to keep formatting on this somewhat consistent, but I’m not making any promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current project I’m working on is currently called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thethe.dev&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Productivia&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but quickly switched to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Productivity&lt;/code&gt;. Hopefully this will end up bing a web/desktop/mobile based task system that levels out the workload you’ve been given to hopefully make your work less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thethe.dev&quot;&gt;thethe.dev&lt;/a&gt; is still called Productivia because I’ve been too lazy to switch it back. Probably doesn’t matter too much because it’s going to be replaced with the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name><email>cam@camerondugan.com</email></author><category term="website" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">I’m not entirely sure what I want this website to be, but for now it will mainly be a blog/link to various projects I’ve made or other’s projects that I really like.</summary></entry></feed>
