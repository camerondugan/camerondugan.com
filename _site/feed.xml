&lt;p&gt;Something that I need to remember is that reflection has it’s limitations. It’s limitations being that after the 30 second mark, you’re probably just procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of procrastination, this blog post is a way for me to take my mind off of the stuff I have to do in the next two days. I’ve got a lot. I tend to have problems with tasks when I don’t like doing it to the extent where I avoid thinking about it. The only way I’ve found a way to do these kinds of things is to try to make it something I automatically do without thinking. Usually by tacking it on the end of something I already do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two issues with this. If I don’t do that thing that triggers the automatic action, the task won’t get done. The second issue is that I don’t know that I didn’t do it. 
My goal here is to think by writing and get to a solution that works. A secondary goal is to get better at writing, so I eventually don’t hesitate to make a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the issue of not wanting to think about hard tasks I could try to streamline my calendar/task system, but I’m notorious for using that as a way to procrastinate. Maybe it’s a motivational issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe… Or, I could try to solve the lack of motivation with some kind of reward? No… I can’t think of anything that would work as a reward. In order for there to be a reward, rules must be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe adding some rules to my life would make it more structured and meaningful. It’s worth a shot. Time to think of some examples, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layout: Problem: Solution by adhering a rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distraction: Reduce distracting entertainment by removing things that make me start watching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distraction/Procrastination:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make a template for an average day&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plan out specific things I’ll work on with estimated duration.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Profit/Actually get things done&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can avoid procrastination by forcing a habit of doing everything as early as I can, while changing my environment to help reduce distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure I don’t go completely insane, I think I’ll throw on music while I work to help my morale last long enough to get everything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, I guess it’s time for me to go do the things I don’t want to do. Cya, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Motivation is overrated.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Crypto Adventures</title><link href="https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/crypto/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Crypto Adventures" /><published>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/my-crypto-adventures</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/crypto/">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:
	I had saved up a bunch of crypto that I had mined in my free time over the course of about 10 or so months. Then I decided that I didn’t like having all of my money in bitcoin, so I decided to use a coin exchange to convert some of it to etherium. Enter: my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had decided that I didn’t want to spend more than 1 USD to make the transaction, so I lowered the “fuel” on the transaction. Turns out, I had lowered it to the point where nobody would take the transaction. It took about a month before it became profitable to somebody to look at my transaction. All the while I wasn’t sure whether or not the exchange would just drop my request because of the time it was taking. Luckily, nothing bad happened and I have my crypto back in my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really unpleasant looking at that 0 balance for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways hope you enjoyed and have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome To My Blog</title><link href="https://www.camerondugan.com/welcome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome To My Blog" /><published>2021-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.camerondugan.com/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.camerondugan.com/welcome/">&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure what I want this website to be, but for now it will mainly be a blog/links to various projects I’ve made or other’s projects that I really like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also try to add an RSS-Roll, hopefully it’ll be a landmine of good feeds that I subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to keep formatting on this somewhat consistent, but I’m not making any promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current project I’m working on is currently called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thethe.dev&quot;&gt;Productivia&lt;/a&gt; but quickly switched to Productivity. Hopefully this will end up bing a web/desktop/mobile based task system that levels out the workload you’ve been given to hopefully make your work less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thethe.dev&quot;&gt;thethe.dev&lt;/a&gt; is still called Productivia because I’ve been too lazy to switch it back. Probably doesn’t matter too much because it’s going to be replaced with the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">I’m not entirely sure what I want this website to be, but for now it will mainly be a blog/links to various projects I’ve made or other’s projects that I really like.</summary></entry></feed>
