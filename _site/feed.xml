I’m going to start publicly doing some to increase specific skills I want to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I suspect nobody will read this, I want you to participate to whatever degree you feel is comfortable. Here are the rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s theme is going to be &lt;em&gt;Text Generation&lt;/em&gt;. Generate any kind of text, it has to be random to some degree. Searching for algorithms online is greatly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete the task to any degree using any language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new task will come out every Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post the result somewhere by Sunday as proof of completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be scoring as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants who tried get a score of 1 for each project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants who learned something new get an additional 2 points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants who didn’t try get a score of 0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants who copy large chunks of code get their project score cut in half rounded down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring will be entirely done on the honor system. Feel free to include your current score along with your post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your time, quality is way better than quantity, and I’m excited to see what we can do!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Programming projects help programmers get better.

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about what I did yesterday for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I wanted to get done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the creatures move in different ways when player moves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start making some starting rooms that will make it into the final game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I actually got done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I fixed a major bug with activating dialogue with NPCs.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For NPCs that are bigger than one tile, it failed to recognize anything other than bumping into the top left-most tile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created more rooms and realized where the fun of the game is: movement and puzzles. I know that sounds dumb, of course the fun is in moving around and doing things, but seriously, I forgot and was putting way too much focus on dialogue and other ridiculous stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also changed the color palate based on how far the player was in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gifs/devlog/space_2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do with the game from here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the game could be quite interesting with a time mechanic tied into the corruption mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea is to have corruption stay if the player doesn’t finish the room in a certain amount of time. Otherwise, the corruption will get reset by “the system”. This should allow for some nuance between completing the rooms fast and strategizing when to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also plan to have more rooms added into the game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Log 2</title><link href="https://www.camerondugan.com/devlog-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Log 2" /><published>2021-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.camerondugan.com/devlog-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.camerondugan.com/devlog-2/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, I have finally decided on a direction for this game. You are a robot in a post human society and something isn’t right. Reality is slipping. Nothing from your sensors are to be trusted. To make things worse, red creatures seem to be making things worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gifs/devlog/space_0.gif&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weird player movement animation when one player bumps into a wall, and another player doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added the red creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made meditating robot float up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to do tommorrow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creatures move in different ways when player moves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start making some starting levels that will hopefully make it into the final game&lt;/li&gt;

My goal is to publish on itch.io or on my own website by the end of the year. I suspect its possible to finish the game well before then, but I know I’ll end up taking my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/devlog/space_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I’m throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks. Now that I think about it, I’ve been doing that since the beginning of the project. What I like about this process is that it’s always straight forward and it makes deciding what to do a whole lot easier. Although, I still have to be careful and think about what I’m doing. But, most of the time I can be reckless and use git to reset all my changes. Just going for it is really refreshing after such a long period of inaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/devlog/space_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat I went for a top-down puzzle game design because a type of game that I really enjoy. This meant making a top down view of the player, and making it move, setting up collision and boundaries… All of the usual stuff. At my current point in the development I already feel like there are things about the game I am not willing to share. A few surprises perhaps. Hopefully they catch some veteran players of guard while still being fun for new players as well. I’ve found that I have a heavy bias for early difficulty, so I’m doing my best to slow my roll this time around and deliberately bringing up the difficulty as the game continues. Another quirk I’ve found in my development is sometimes I’ll add a new feature into an item only to find out that maybe that feature should be it’s own separate item.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Hi all, I want to retro-actively share my efforts to make a game with pico8.

&lt;p&gt;Computer manufacturers use the complexity of their product to mislead their consumers. They emphasize the cpu in their products and point out how fast their spinning disk hard drive is. This misdirects the consumer from reality. The customer is pushed away from realizing that maybe spinning disk hard drives aren’t in the same speed class as cheap ssd’s, or from that beyond a midrange cpu, the cpu doesn’t play nearly as much of a factor as it might seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no incentive to help the consumer understand what they are doing. If anything, the incentive is to mislead consumers. And this practice misleading happens in most industries with complex products and services. Complexity shouldn’t be this big of a barrier to effective consumer decisions. Computer sale could be put down to a simple 4-5 pointers based on what the consumer wants to do with it. 
Something like an important component graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;moving large files -&amp;gt; ssd
media creation -&amp;gt; ssd gpu cpu
word processing/mail/videochat -&amp;gt; anything/chromebook
gaming -&amp;gt; gpu cpu ram ssd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I don’t know everything here, but I think a sticker or poster with this kind of information at computer stores would save a lot of frustration with hardware. Many customer’s computer angst starts before they turn on their own computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of abuse of customer trust is too prevalent in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other industries that I’m aware of similar practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumer audio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthy food companies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;News, particularly political news&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research publications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nevermind, pretty much every industry, but definitely some more than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think that information just moves too fast with no filters for quality. As the complexity of the world increases, the skills required to decern between quality information and garbage information disappears. Quality information now has to desguise itself as fluff to be seen by anyone. Kind of makes me think that disconnecting entirely is becoming the only option.
Hopefully there will be a new service that restricts both speed and quantity of information to insure a reasonable quality of information. Just enough to start a conversation, but not too much as to give people headaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">The growing complexity in computer science and electronics influences everyone.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hidden Costs</title><link href="https://www.camerondugan.com/hidden-costs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hidden Costs" /><published>2021-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.camerondugan.com/hidden-costs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.camerondugan.com/hidden-costs/">&lt;p&gt;Every programmer has used a development stack. A framework, an API, or maybe a template. Anything that makes money with each use is incentivised to make sure that you, as the developer never switch to an alternative or stop using it. This means that they are also incentivised to make sure that the API becomes deeply implanted into the system that you make. Maybe its a weird timing quirk, or an unexplainable fringe bug. The last quirk of truly evil systems, is that these properties are ensured to be lay hidden until replacing the product becomes costly or timely. I’m not saying that it’s immoral to write or promote these kinds of services to developers, I’m just saying that the effort that goes into them and the effort that goes into replacing and modding them to correctly work with a business can slow or destroy a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last point extends past software or a single industry. Every industry has an inherent need to manipulate the general population to their direct or indirect benefit. Sometimes this means staying quiet about an issue and pressuring internal actors to be quiet or else. Other times, this means that the industry changes the focus of outrage on to something inconsequential. Uprooting these lies is essential for improving society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each industry has its dirty secrets. These secrets can either be critical to business or a big enough PR disaster to heavily cripple that business. Hopefully most of these secrets are nothing to worry about. To protect future business and the better interest in future human civilization, I herby heavily promote whistle-blowing in areas where secrets are worse-off being kept rather than freed. This doesn’t mean that people should throw company or government secrets into the public spotlight just to spite their bureaucratic overlords. Instead only when information that is exposed directly and continually benefits humanity as a whole while dealing minimal damage to the organization in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those have been my thoughts for today.

An ominous feeling of almost guilt, or fear of what’s up ahead. Whether its a homework assignment, a test, or maybe an important meeting, a flight you can’t miss, or really anything that you aren’t looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a minute and think about what you might be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/code&gt; with at the current moment. Sometimes we don’t even notice this feeling, almost like it has integrated itself into our lives. Ultimately if this feeling goes unnoticed, it can make our lives just that much more unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide that you are feeling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/code&gt;, the fastest way to overcome that feeling is to make a battleplan. It might not be easy, but I guarantee that a good plan will help. Knowing what you will do to minimize or illiminate the outcome helps both your state of mind in the current moment and you’ll make a more informed decision when that dreaded moment eventually comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the flipside of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overwhelm&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of something that you wish wouldn’t happen, how about something that you wish will happen. Is there something that you’ve always wanted to do? Mabye a skill you’ve always wanted to learn. Whatever you want to do, the feeling of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overwhelm&lt;/code&gt; can control you here as well. It can paralyze you, stop you from taking even the tiny steps towards the future you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying I’m an expert, or even good at managing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overwhelm&lt;/code&gt;. It’s just that I have a lot of experience with it. It’s one of those things that build while you don’t manage it. Do yourself a favor and ask yourself where you see it appearing or growing and make that battle plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I need to remember is that reflection has it’s limitations. It’s limitations being that after the 30 second mark, you’re probably just procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of procrastination, this blog post is a way for me to take my mind off of the stuff I have to do in the next two days. I’ve got a lot. I tend to have problems with tasks when I don’t like doing it to the extent where I avoid thinking about it. The only way I’ve found a way to do these kinds of things is to try to make it something I automatically do without thinking. Usually by tacking it on the end of something I already do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two issues with this. If I don’t do that thing that triggers the automatic action, the task won’t get done. The second issue is that I don’t know that I didn’t do it. 
My goal here is to think by writing and get to a solution that works. A secondary goal is to get better at writing, so I eventually don’t hesitate to make a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the issue of not wanting to think about hard tasks I could try to streamline my calendar/task system, but I’m notorious for using that as a way to procrastinate. Maybe it’s a motivational issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe… Or, I could try to solve the lack of motivation with some kind of reward? No… I can’t think of anything that would work as a reward. In order for there to be a reward, rules must be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe adding some rules to my life would make it more structured and meaningful. It’s worth a shot. Time to think of some examples, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layout: Problem: Solution by adhering a rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distraction: Reduce distracting entertainment by removing things that make me start watching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distraction/Procrastination:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make a template for an average day&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plan out specific things I’ll work on with estimated duration.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Profit/Actually get things done&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can avoid procrastination by forcing a habit of doing everything as early as I can, while changing my environment to help reduce distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure I don’t go completely insane, I think I’ll throw on music while I work to help my morale last long enough to get everything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, I guess it’s time for me to go do the things I don’t want to do. Cya, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Motivation is overrated.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Crypto Adventures</title><link href="https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/crypto/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Crypto Adventures" /><published>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/my-crypto-adventures</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.camerondugan.com/blog/crypto/">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:
	I had saved up a bunch of crypto that I had mined in my free time over the course of about 10 or so months. Then I decided that I didn’t like having all of my money in bitcoin, so I decided to use a coin exchange to convert some of it to etherium. Enter: my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had decided that I didn’t want to spend more than 1 USD to make the transaction, so I lowered the “fuel” on the transaction. Turns out, I had lowered it to the point where nobody would take the transaction. It took about a month before it became profitable to somebody to look at my transaction. All the while I wasn’t sure whether or not the exchange would just drop my request because of the time it was taking. Luckily, nothing bad happened and I have my crypto back in my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really unpleasant looking at that 0 balance for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways hope you enjoyed and have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cameron Dugan</name></author><summary type="html">Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post…</summary></entry></feed>
