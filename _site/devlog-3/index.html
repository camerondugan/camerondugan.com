<p>I want to talk about what I did yesterday for the game.</p>

<p>What I wanted to get done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make the creatures move in different ways when player moves.</li>
  <li>Start making some starting rooms that will make it into the final game.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I actually got done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I fixed a major bug with activating dialogue with NPCs.
    <ul>
      <li>For NPCs that are bigger than one tile, it failed to recognize anything other than bumping into the top left-most tile.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I created more rooms and realized where the fun of the game is: movement and puzzles. I know that sounds dumb, of course the fun is in moving around and doing things, but seriously, I forgot and was putting way too much focus on dialogue and other ridiculous stuff.</li>
  <li>I also changed the color palate based on how far the player was in the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I want to do with the game from here:</p>

<p>I think the game could be quite interesting with a time mechanic tied into the corruption mechanic.</p>

<p>My idea is to have corruption stay if the player doesn‚Äôt finish the room in a certain amount of time. Otherwise, the corruption will get reset by ‚Äúthe system‚Äù. This should allow for some nuance between completing the rooms fast and strategizing when to slow down.</p>

<p>I also plan to have more rooms added into the game.</p>
