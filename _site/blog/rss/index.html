There simply isn’t anything to that will recommend new feeds. This makes building up your feed list a hastle, especially if websites don’t list their feed urls anywhere. As I’ve continued to use <abbr title="Really Simple Sindication">RSS</abbr>, I see an increase in it’s value as a tool to create a more decentralized and safer internet.</p> <p>We need a Spotify, Pandora, or a Facebook for but just for <abbr title="Really Simple Sindication">RSS</abbr> and without the creepy tracking/cyber-stalking. Just a simple website with a recommendation engine built off of other people’s feeds. A good feature on top of the recommendation would be to have a public profile on the site, that you can link your friends to with feeds you recommend to others.</p> <p>Assuming basic security and encryption practices are put in place, I think this idea has a ton of promise to help a lot of people without being bloated or a menace to privacy. For additional privacy, the website could allow users to choose which feeds to enable as publicly recommended.</p> <p>Honestly, since the idea isn’t crazy big, and if this doesn’t already exist, I think I’ll take a stab at trying to make this eventually.</p> <p>If you also want to see this happen or if you know of a website that already does this, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p> <br> <hr> <h2>🪧 Enjoy Reading This?</h2> <p>Here are some more you might like to read next:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/blog/quantum-internet/">Quantum Internet</a> - 📅 Jan 21st 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/opposites/">Things Lead to Their Opposites</a> - 📅 Apr 2nd 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/whypeopledontcode/">Why People Don't Code</a> - 📅 Mar 29th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/expectations/">The Cost of Expectations</a> - 📅 Feb 19th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/companion-databases/">Companion Databases</a> - 📅 Feb 1st 2022 </ul> <br> <hr> <h2>💬 Looking for comments?</h2> <p>I don't have comments on this site as they can be time consuming to manage.
