Society relies on software to such an extreme degree that it seems that programming would be an essential tool taught in schools to help most desk/laptop style jobs. In-fact, I would have gone as far to argue that programming should be used as the primary method of solving modern problems. Solve them once, hopefully never have to solve it again.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/cool-graphics/tubes.jpg" alt="picture"/></p> <p>This brings me to my understanding today, that people are tired and don’t want to have to sit through every semantic or syntactical error just to solve a problem they already know how to solve by hand.</p> <p>Knowing how to program well is very useful, knowing how to program poorly is practically worthless. I appreciate institutional efforts to incorporate computers and software into education, but seems like it almost should be the center, where a lot of problems can be expressed and solved just as fast, if not faster through computer programs.</p> <p>Obviously I’m biased, and there are exceptions, and I don’t know exactly what I’m talking about, but it seems like a good idea to provide the option of an education purely through a computer science lens.</p> <p>Matlab and R are the closest things to what I want to express. Classrooms use Matlab and R, but mostly as calculator replacements.</p> <p>Just realized that students would probably code like they’re still using a calculator and gain no benefit and much headache from a lazy inclusion of programming.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/cool-graphics/human+AI.jpg" alt="image"/></p> <p>Being able to better work with our machine friends is going to be a key part of our future, and learning to speak some of their language is a great start.</p> <p>And thats what’s been on my mind recently, thanks for reading! I’ll post more stuff soon (probably about that AI I’m working on).</p> <br> <hr> <h2>🪧 Enjoy Reading This?</h2> <p>Here are some more you might like to read next:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/blog/opposites/">Things Lead to Their Opposites</a> - 📅 Apr 2nd 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/expectations/">The Cost of Expectations</a> - 📅 Feb 19th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/complexity/">Complexity</a> - 📅 May 22nd 2021 <li><p><a href="/blog/hidden-costs/">Hidden Costs</a> - 📅 May 21st 2021 <li><p><a href="/blog/wave-collapse/">Wave Function Collapse</a> - 📅 Apr 28th 2022 </ul> <br> <hr> <h2>💬 Looking for comments?</h2> <p>I don't have comments on this site as they can be time consuming to manage.
