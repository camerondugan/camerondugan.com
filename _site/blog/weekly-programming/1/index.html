<p>Programming projects help programmers get better. I‚Äôm going to start publicly doing some to increase specific skills I want to work on.</p>

<p>This week‚Äôs theme is going to be <em>Image Generation</em>. You can create a program that takes in a series of images, and outputs an image based on those previous works. You could also create a program that fills in missing/transparent sections of an image.</p>

<p>Hopefully these ideas help you create wacky results.</p>

<p>The rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the task to any degree using any language.</li>
  <li>A new task will come out every Monday.</li>
  <li>Post the result somewhere by Sunday as proof of completion.</li>
</ol>

<p>There will be scoring as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Participants who tried, get a score of 1 for each project.</li>
  <li>Participants who learned something new get an additional 2 points.</li>
  <li>Participants who didn‚Äôt try get a score of 0.</li>
  <li>Participants who copy large chunks of code get their project score cut in half rounded down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scoring will be entirely done on the honor system. Feel free to include your current score along with your post.
Example: My current score is 1.</p>

<p>Take your time, I‚Äôm excited to see what we can do!</p>

<p>I don't have comments on this site as they're difficult to manage and take up too much time. I'd rather concentrate on programming cool and new things than managing comments.</p>
