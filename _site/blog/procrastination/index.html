It’s limitations being that after the 30 second mark, you’re probably just procrastinating.</p> <p>Speaking of procrastination, this blog post is a way for me to take my mind off of the stuff I have to do in the next two days. I’ve got a lot. I tend to have problems with tasks when I don’t like doing it to the extent where I avoid thinking about it. The only way I’ve found a way to do these kinds of things is to try to make it something I automatically do without thinking. Usually by tacking it on the end of something I already do every day.</p> <p>The two issues with this. If I don’t do that thing that triggers the automatic action, the task won’t get done. The second issue is that I don’t know that I didn’t do it. My goal here is to think by writing and get to a solution that works. A secondary goal is to get better at writing, so I eventually don’t hesitate to make a post.</p> <p>To mitigate the issue of not wanting to think about hard tasks I could try to streamline my calendar/task system, but I’m notorious for using that as a way to procrastinate. Maybe it’s a motivational issue?</p> <p>Maybe… Or, I could try to solve the lack of motivation with some kind of reward? No… I can’t think of anything that would work as a reward. In order for there to be a reward, rules must be put in place.</p> <p>Maybe adding some rules to my life would make it more structured and meaningful. It’s worth a shot. Time to think of some examples, I guess.</p> <p>Layout: Problem: Solution by adhering a rule.</p> <ol> <li>Distraction: Reduce distracting entertainment by removing things that make me start watching</li> <li>Distraction/Procrastination: <ol> <li>Make a template for an average day</li> <li>Plan out specific things I’ll work on with estimated duration.</li> <li>???</li> <li>Profit/Actually get things done</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>Maybe I can avoid procrastination by forcing a habit of doing everything as early as I can, while changing my environment to help reduce distractions.</p> <p>To ensure I don’t go completely insane, I think I’ll throw on music while I work to help my morale last long enough to get everything done.</p> <p>Alrighty, I guess it’s time for me to go do the things I don’t want to do.
