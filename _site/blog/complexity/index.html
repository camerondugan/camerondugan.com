They emphasize the cpu in their products and point out how fast their spinning disk hard drive is. This misdirects the consumer from reality. The customer is pushed away from realizing that maybe spinning disk hard drives aren’t in the same speed class as cheap ssd’s, or from that beyond a midrange cpu, the cpu doesn’t play nearly as much of a factor as it might seem.</p> <p>There’s no incentive to help the consumer understand what they are doing. If anything, the incentive is to mislead consumers. And this practice misleading happens in most industries with complex products and services. Complexity shouldn’t be this big of a barrier to effective consumer decisions. Computer sale could be put down to a simple 4-5 pointers based on what the consumer wants to do with it. Something like an important component graph:</p> <p>moving large files -&gt; ssd media creation -&gt; ssd gpu cpu word processing/mail/videochat -&gt; anything/chromebook gaming -&gt; gpu cpu ram ssd</p> <p>Obviously, I don’t know everything here, but I think a sticker or poster with this kind of information at computer stores would save a lot of frustration with hardware. Many customer’s computer angst starts before they turn on their own computer.</p> <p>This kind of abuse of customer trust is too prevalent in the tech industry.</p> <p>Other industries that I’m aware of similar practices:</p> <ul> <li>Consumer audio</li> <li>Healthy food companies</li> <li>News, particularly political news</li> <li>Research publications</li> <li>Nevermind, pretty much every industry, but definitely some more than others.</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes I think that information just moves too fast with no filters for quality. As the complexity of the world increases, the skills required to decern between quality information and garbage information disappears. Quality information now has to desguise itself as fluff to be seen by anyone. Kind of makes me think that disconnecting entirely is becoming the only option. Hopefully there will be a new service that restricts both speed and quantity of information to insure a reasonable quality of information. Just enough to start a conversation, but not too much as to give people headaches.</p> <br> <hr> <h2>🪧 Enjoy Reading This?</h2> <p>Here are some more you might like to read next:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/blog/whypeopledontcode/">Why People Don't Code</a> - 📅 Mar 29th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/hidden-costs/">Hidden Costs</a> - 📅 May 21st 2021 <li><p><a href="/blog/wave-collapse/">Wave Function Collapse</a> - 📅 Apr 28th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/opposites/">Things Lead to Their Opposites</a> - 📅 Apr 2nd 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/op1/">The OP-1 Synth</a> - 📅 Feb 28th 2022 </ul> <br> <hr> <h2>💬 Looking for comments?</h2> <p>I don't have comments on this site as they can be time consuming to manage.
