<code> Transmission <b>#1</b>
- Signal: <b>Faint</b>
</code> 
<span style="float:right;">üìÖ Apr 5th 2021</span>

<p>Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Background:
	I had saved up a bunch of crypto that I had mined in my free time over the course of about 10 or so months. Then I decided that I didn‚Äôt like having all of my money in bitcoin, so I decided to use a coin exchange to convert some of it to etherium. Enter: my mistake.</p>

<p>I had decided that I didn‚Äôt want to spend more than 1 USD to make the transaction, so I lowered the ‚Äúfuel‚Äù on the transaction. Turns out, I had lowered it to the point where nobody would take the transaction. It took about a month before it became profitable to somebody to look at my transaction. All the while I wasn‚Äôt sure whether or not the exchange would just drop my request because of the time it was taking. Luckily, nothing bad happened and I have my crypto back in my wallet.</p>

<p>It was really unpleasant looking at that 0 balance for a month.</p>

<p>Anyways hope you enjoyed and have a wonderful day.</p>
