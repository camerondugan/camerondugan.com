That in order to be hungry, you must have been full. In order for you to be happy, you must have some kind of sadness to compare the experience to.</p> <p>These things are all true because they have to be.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/cool-graphics/circuitry.jpg" alt="circuitry"/></p> <p>Change only occurs because there was and then there wasn’t. Logic like this drives humanity. Nothing is constant… is the only constant. Adapting and overcoming is standard mode of operation and is thus not an adaptation. Contradiction is a standard part of any logic system, it’s inescapable. Logic is infinitely complex but in many ways so simple, that it would be unthinkable for it to not contradict itself somewhere.</p> <p>Beliefs are systems of logic that exist to simply the infinitely complex reality we live in. Beliefs are tools to be used and not pieces of our identity. Identity changes constantly, and holding onto it too tightly can cause unnecessary suffering. No belief is 100% accurate, there are always contradictions, and there is always some margin of error.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/cool-graphics/architecture.jpg" alt="circuitry"/></p> <p>And if you re-learn anything from this post: Don’t believe every thought that you think.</p> <p>Also, human behavior change mainly starts with habits, not a state of mind, and especially not a list of strange sentences.</p> <br> <hr> <h2>🪧 Enjoy Reading This?</h2> <p>Here are some more you might like to read next:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/blog/whypeopledontcode/">Why People Don't Code</a> - 📅 Mar 29th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/expectations/">The Cost of Expectations</a> - 📅 Feb 19th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/companion-databases/">Companion Databases</a> - 📅 Feb 1st 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/end-of-thinking/">The End of Thinking</a> - 📅 Jan 25th 2022 <li><p><a href="/blog/qrcodes/">Observations about QR codes</a> - 📅 Jan 23rd 2022 </ul> <br> <hr> <h2>💬 Looking for comments?</h2> <p>I don't have comments on this site as they can be time consuming to manage.
