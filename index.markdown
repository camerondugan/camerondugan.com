A personal blog/devlog/cool-thing-bookmarker written in markdown by me and converted into a static website using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

It even comes equipped with an RSS feed! Didn't take too long to setup either, 10/10 would recommend!

Plus it can be converted into a gemini site, which I will do in a bit, pretty worn out after figuring out what I have so far.

Code for this website can be found in the about tab!
