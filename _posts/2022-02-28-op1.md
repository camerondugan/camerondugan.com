The OP-1 is a computer-keyboard sized synth with just enough capability to mostly replace a DAW.

I'm a programmer with quite a bit of piano playing experience. My idea with the purchase of the OP-1 was to be able to make my own sounds and music for whatever software I end up making. 

I wanted to list everything that it can do, but I feel like it's more effective if I just link to a Red Means Recording video where he uses the OP-1 to create a full song.

It's strengths are it's looping, sampling, and especially it's synth customization options.

You can import instruments and drum kits by recording with the mic or with the audio input jack.

It manages to be understandable with very few instructions through conventional symbols and an info button for when you can't figure out what something does. 

That's about all I have to say, I've been enjoying using it for making short songs and unique sounds.

Hope you found it as interesting as I did.
