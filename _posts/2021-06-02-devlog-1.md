Hi all, I want to retro-actively share my efforts to make  a game with pico8. My goal is to publish on itch.io or on my own website by the end of the year. I suspect its possible to finish the game well before then, but I know I'll end up taking my time.

Currently, I'm throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks. Now that I think about it, I've been doing that since the beginning of the project. What I like about this process is that it's always straight forward and it makes deciding what to do a whole lot easier. Although, I still have to be careful and think about what I'm doing. But, most of the time I can be reckless and use git to reset all my changes. Just going for it is really refreshing after such a long period of inaction.

Right off the bat I went for a top-down puzzle game design because a type of game that I really enjoy. This meant making a top down view of the player, and making it move, setting up collision and boundaries... All of the usual stuff. At my current point in the development I already feel like there are things about the game I am not willing to share. A few surprises perhaps. Hopefully they catch some veteran players of guard while still being fun for new players as well. I've found that I have a heavy bias for early difficulty, so I'm doing my best to slow my roll this time around and deliberately bringing up the difficulty as the game continues. Another quirk I've found in my development is sometimes I'll add a new feature into an item only to find out that maybe that feature should be it's own separate item.
