I'm not entirely sure what I want this website to be, but for now it will mainly be a blog/links to various projects I've made or other's projects that I really like.

I'll also try to add an RSS-Roll, hopefully it'll be a landmine of good feeds that I subscribe to.

I'll try to keep formatting on this somewhat consistent, but I'm not making any promises.

The current project I'm working on is currently called [Productivia](https://thethe.dev) but quickly switched to `Productivity`. Hopefully this will end up bing a web/desktop/mobile based task system that levels out the workload you've been given to hopefully make your work less stressful.

[thethe.dev](https://thethe.dev) is still called Productivia because I've been too lazy to switch it back. Probably doesn't matter too much because it's going to be replaced with the finished product.
