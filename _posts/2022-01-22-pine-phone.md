Last night I had a hard time sleeping.

The Pine Phone has been on my radar for a while now. But only recently have I started looking at it as potentially fun side project. I want a Linux phone, but I also want a good Linux phone. The Pine Phone seems to be pretty good, but I don't think that I'll end up buying it. I might buy the Pine Phone Pro instead, because it has the hardware to properly deliver Linux. I'm not sure if I'm ready to drop $400 on a phone who's software isn't fully developed. On the other hand, I could try to help out in my free time and make this dream a reality. I'm hesitating now only because there isn't a confirmed port for my current phone(although there is a port for the XL version so idk). I don't want to use my main phone to try to port Linux to when I need it for school to demonstrate that I'm following Covid testing protocol. Tricky... I think I might pre-order the Pine Phone / Pine Phone Pro, and when it arrives I'll set it up to properly access the website and display my status, then porting over my main phone to Linux using the Pine Phone in the meantime.

Idk, this decision is keeping me up at night with the insane possibility of running Linux on a phone that I would actually use.

Update before published: Pre-ordered the Pine Phone Pro, wish me luck :)
