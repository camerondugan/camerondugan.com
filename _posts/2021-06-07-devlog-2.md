Welcome back, I have finally decided on a direction for this game. You are a robot in a post human society and something isn't right. Reality is slipping. Nothing from your sensors are to be trusted. To make things worse, red creatures seem to be making things worse.

Bugs fixed:
1. Weird player movement animation when one player bumps into a wall, and another player doesn't.

Other things:
1. Added the red creatures.
1. Made meditating robot float up and down

Things to do tommorrow:
1. Creatures move in different ways when player moves
1. Start making some starting levels that will hopefully make it into the final game
