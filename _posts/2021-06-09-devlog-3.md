I want to talk about what I did yesterday for the game. 

What I wanted to get done:
1. Make the creatures move in different ways when player moves.
1. Start making some starting rooms that will make it into the final game.

What I actually got done:
1. I fixed a major bug with activating dialogue with NPCs.
 - For NPCs that are bigger than one tile, it failed to recognize anything other than bumping into the top left-most tile.
1. I created more rooms and realized where the fun of the game is: movement and puzzles. I know that sounds dumb, of course the fun is in moving around and doing things, but seriously, I forgot and was putting way too much focus on dialogue and other ridiculous stuff.
1. I also changed the color palate based on how far the player was in the game.

What I want to do with the game from here:

I think the game could be quite interesting with a time mechanic tied into the corruption mechanic.

My idea is to have corruption stay if the player doesn't finish the room in a certain amount of time. Otherwise, the corruption will get reset by "the system". This should allow for some nuance between completing the rooms fast and strategizing when to slow down.

I also plan to have more rooms added into the game.
