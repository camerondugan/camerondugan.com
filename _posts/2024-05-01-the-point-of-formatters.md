I heard from somewhere that formatters are going to slow down the top
percentage of programmers. Let's talk about that.


## Problem

The valid points I heard were something like:
- Could reduce productivity of the top coders.
- Removes the customization you can have when writing code

And if you agree with these points, then I suggest to not use a formatter. At
the end of the day, formatters are supposed to be a tool to help you achieve
what you want.

## Solution

When you create a tool, you want your tool to be the most useful to the
greatest number of people. Formatters are just a tool. Here's why you would
want to use a formatter:
- Consistency: There's no need to adjust where to look for something when jumping from
project to project, file to file, or line to line.
- Faster code creation: If wanted, you could write code without any spacing or
formatting, and skip those keystrokes and let an auto-formatter apply your
preferred changes.
- Guidance: It's perfect for newbies and polyglots who want others looking at
their code, it's formatted "correctly" for that use case every time.

As always, hope someone found this helpful. Tchau.
