This post, like most post is just a reminder to my future self.

Life isn't a race. Sometimes it's hard to remember, but knowing when to sprint and, when to jog and, when to walk is super important. If life was a race, it would be a marathon, the best racers know how to pace themselves, when to sprint, when to jog, and when to walk.

## Pacing Yourself

Not everything you do has to be done to the max. If you disagree, then you need to think for a little longer. People who run at 100% 24/7 burn out. The people that go the furthest can pace themselves for long term success. It doesn't matter so much that you always win, it just matters that you win more overall in the long run. 

It's all about lining up dominos for the future instead of worrying about how many dominos you can knock down today.

Have a great week!
