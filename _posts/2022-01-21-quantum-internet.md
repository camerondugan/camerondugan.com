The internet has reached a stage that I feel comfortable in calling pretty darn fast. The only problem is that we need to physically wire our devices together in order for them to become useful. Quantum Internet is a theoretical invention where, because of Quantum entaglement, we can enstablish secure, remote connections with other devices without a physical connection to an ISP. Instead, communication would happen at the quantum level, perfectly instant at any distance.

Quantum Internet could efficienty behave as a super quantum computer. Quantum computers are already op, but what if they could network together to poll resources and information.

Why it would be another computer revolution:
+ Limitless pooled computing for science and for fun
+ Users could get paid to improve slow services.
+ Actually instant communication globally
+ It sounds cool

Why this probably won't happen:
+ Quantum Entaglement on purpose at the moment requires close proximity to be established, and it doesn't last long
