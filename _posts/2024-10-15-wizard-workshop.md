The idea is to create an interesting automated card game experience. Title is
placeholder for now. But here are some assets that I've created for this

An unlock for cloning.

A goblin hiding in a cave.

An impenetrable wall of sheep.

And this is a preview of what I have coded for the game so far.

In the beginning you will play the game like any other card game, but as you go
further and further, you will realize that the necessity for automation grows
too strong. You will be able to influence how your deck is automatically played,
and you will get rewards for when your deck does well. May the best wizard win.

A lot of groundwork has been laid out in ways that allow future development to
be easier. Using the pieces of the game engine as intended and keeping things
modular should help things stay organized. If you are interested in seeing more
of this game as it is developed, feel free to shoot me an email. I love hearing
back from the community about what I write. 

**I want your craziest card ideas!**
