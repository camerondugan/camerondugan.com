Programming projects help programmers get better. I'm going to start publicly doing some to increase specific skills I want to work on.

Although I suspect nobody will read this, I want you to participate to whatever degree you feel is comfortable. Here are the rules:

This week's theme is going to be *Text Generation*. Generate any kind of text, it has to be random to some degree. Searching for algorithms online is greatly encouraged.

1. Complete the task to any degree using any language.
1. A new task will come out every Monday.
1. Post the result somewhere by Sunday as proof of completion.

There will be scoring as follows:
* Participants who tried get a score of 1 for each project.
* Participants who learned something new get an additional 2 points.
* Participants who didn't try get a score of 0.
* Participants who copy large chunks of code get their project score cut in half rounded down.

Scoring will be entirely done on the honor system. Feel free to include your current score along with your post.

Take your time, quality is way better than quantity, and I'm excited to see what we can do!
