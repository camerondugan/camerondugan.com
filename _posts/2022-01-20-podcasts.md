Podcasts are getting quite good recently, so I've decided to recommend some podcasts and software I use for accessing them.

+ [The Minimalists](https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/){:target="_blank"}
	+ Suit and tie corporate guys talk about a meaningful life with less.
+ [Safety Third](https://safetythirdpod.com/){:target="_blank"}
	+ Internet science celebrities talk about what they do.
+ [The Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/){:target="_blank"}
	+ Tim Ferris explores new and bizarre topics every episode.
+ [The WAN Show](https://chartable.com/podcasts/the-wan-show-podcast/episodes){:target="_blank"}
	+ Tech news + Linus Media Group behind the scenes.

All of these podcasts I have on auto-download using: [Antenna Pod](https://antennapod.org/){:target="_blank"} on Android.
You don't have to try them all, but I highly recommend checking out at least one that you find interesting.
