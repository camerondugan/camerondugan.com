Arbidor is a short game I programmed, it's still unfinished and it's definitely confusing. Intentional programming errors are everywhere, it's your job to use them to your advantage to reach the end.

The top left indicates when the level will automatically reset.
The top Right indicates when the whole game resets.

Controls
: Arrows to move 
: x/z to interact or reset the level at the cost of battery
: Most controllers are supported


Compiles to web, windows, mac, and linux
