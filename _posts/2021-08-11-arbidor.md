Arbidor is a short game I programmed, it's still unfinished and it's definitely confusing. Intentional programming errors are everywhere, it's your job to use them to your advantage to reach the end.

Watch out, your battery drains while you play. Collect batteries to replenish your battery! The top left features a reset indicator, it lets you know when the game attempts a partial reset.

The top left indicates when the level will automatically reset.
The top Right indicates when the whole game resets.

Controls
: Arrows to move
: x/z to interact or fully reset the level at the cost of battery
: Most controllers are supported
