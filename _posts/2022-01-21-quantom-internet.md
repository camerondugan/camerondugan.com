The internet has reached a stage that I feel comfortable in calling pretty darn fast. The only problem is that we need to physically wire our devices together in order for them to become useful. Quantom Internet is a theoretical invention where, because of Quantom entaglement, we can enstablish secure, remote connections with other devices without a physical connection to an ISP. Instead, communication would happen at the quantom level, perfectly instant at any distance. 

Quantom Internet could efficienty behave as a super quantom computer. Quantom computers are already op, but what if they could network together to poll resources and information. 

Why it would be another computer revolution:
+ Limitless pooled computing for science and for fun
+ Users could get paid to improve slow services.
+ Actually instant communication globaly
+ It sounds cool

Why this probably won't happen:
+ Quantom Entaglement on purpose at the moment requires close proximity to be established, and it doesn't last long
