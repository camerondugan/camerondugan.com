<p>I’m not entirely sure what I want this website to be, but for now it will mainly be a blog/links to various projects I’ve made or other’s projects that I really like.</p>

<p>I’ll also try to add an RSS-Roll, hopefully it’ll be a landmine of good feeds that I subscribe to.</p>

<p>I’ll try to keep formatting on this somewhat consistent, but I’m not making any promises.</p>

<p>The current project I’m working on is currently called <a href="https://thethe.dev">Productivia</a> but quickly switched to Productivity. Hopefully this will end up bing a web/desktop/mobile based task system that levels out the workload you’ve been given to hopefully make your work less stressful.</p>

<p><a href="https://thethe.dev">thethe.dev</a> is still called Productivia because I’ve been too lazy to switch it back. Probably doesn’t matter too much because it’s going to be replaced with the finished product.</p>
