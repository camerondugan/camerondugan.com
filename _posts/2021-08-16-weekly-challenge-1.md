Programming projects help programmers get better. I'm going to start publicly doing some to increase specific skills I want to work on.

This week's theme is going to be *Image Generation*. You can create a program that takes in a series of images, and outputs an image based on those previous works. You could also create a program that fills in missing/transparent sections of an image.

Hopefully these ideas help you create wacky results.

The rules are as follows:

1. Complete the task to any degree using any language.
1. A new task will come out every Monday.
1. Post the result somewhere by Sunday as proof of completion.

There will be scoring as follows:
* Participants who tried, get a score of 1 for each project.
* Participants who learned something new get an additional 2 points.
* Participants who didn't try get a score of 0.
* Participants who copy large chunks of code get their project score cut in half rounded down.

Scoring will be entirely done on the honor system. Feel free to include your current score along with your post.
Example: My current score is 1.

Take your time, I'm excited to see what we can do!
