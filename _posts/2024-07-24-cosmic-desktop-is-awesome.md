I've done a lot of DE switches through these past few years. And I've always
been a fan of PopOS's tiling features and I've tried many tiling window managers
to find that most of them are not for me.

The main reason being that there was always so much configuration that needed to
happen in order for the computer to start to behave normally again. Like USB
mounting behavior, screen brightness, and volume keys not bound by default. The
more you strip away from a DE the more you realize you relied on magic.

So for years now I've used tiling plugins or weird hacks or PopOS's own tiling
extension for Gnome. These have all fallen short of the immaculate experience I
am currently having on this Cosmic DE. Nothing comes close to the buttery
smoothness that is Cosmic.

Everything makes sense, and nothing is hacked together last minute. Here's what
I mean. To switch windows, its `Super+arrow` or `Super+<hjkl>`, whatever is more
familiar to you. Next, to switch virtual desktops, use these same shortcuts but
aim for the virtual work space you want. For me, it's setup vertically as it
gives less motion on the screen.

The other benefit: it's stupid fast. No other desktop experience feels quite as
snappy. Window managers are quite comparable, but usually lack the essentials.
Their speed is driven by how little they actually do for you.

One final thing, customization looks like it will be really great. I've setup my
cosmic desktop to use [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/cosmic-desktop)

Hope you are as excited about the future of the Linux desktop as I am. Even if
not, have a great day! Thank you for reading!
