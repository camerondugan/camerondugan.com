Hello and welcome to my second ever blog post...

Background:
	I had saved up a bunch of crypto that I had mined in my free time over the course of about 10 or so months. Then I decided that I didn't like having all of my money in bitcoin, so I decided to use a coin exchange to convert some of it to etherium. Enter: my mistake.

I had decided that I didn't want to spend more than 1 USD to make the transaction, so I lowered the "fuel" on the transaction. Turns out, I had lowered it to the point where nobody would take the transaction. It took about a month before it became profitable to somebody to look at my transaction. All the while I wasn't sure whether or not the exchange would just drop my request because of the time it was taking. Luckily, nothing bad happened and I have my crypto back in my wallet. 

It was really unpleasant looking at that 0 balance for a month.

Anyways hope you enjoyed and have a wonderful day.
