<h2>💬 Looking for comments?</h2>

<p>I don't have comments on this site as they're difficult to manage and take up too much time. I'd rather concentrate on programming cool and new things than managing comments.</p>

<p>Since you can't leave a comment, feel free to ✉️ <a href="/contact">contact me</a> instead.</p>
